# FTC_Robot_Tester

This program can be used to test individual motors and servos on a REV Expansion Hub or Control Hub. It also can test the gamepad and display IMU values.

It uses the Dpad to go through menus on the Driver Station. Dpad up and down move the cursor, and Dpad right selects an item. Dpad left exits the current menu and goes back to the previous menu.

It is a work in progress. Currently it lists all the motors and servos in the selected configuration. In the future it will allow selecting all motor or servo ports, even if not in the configuration file.
